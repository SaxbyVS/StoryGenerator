# Story Generator Project Report

## Challenges Faced
 - Controller Crowding
	- Since the Story encompasses potentially so many pieces of data, the StoryController routing to StoryModel seemed like it was going to be very crowded.
	- To solve this and to separate data elements that may be exclusive from others, I created 4 separate controllers including: StoryController, CharacterController, SettingsController, and WorldController. This way, stories which include these elements based on their chosen story type can be edited in their own unique windows using their respective controllers.
